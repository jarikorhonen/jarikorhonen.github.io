## Research Profile

During my research career, I have been working on several different topics, mostly related to multimedia communications and Quality of Experience (QoE). I did my PhD about packet loss resilient audio streaming for Nokia Research Center, Tampere, Finland, during 2001-06. Since 2008, I have been working mostly on visual and audiovisual quality assessment, covering both subjective methodologies and objective quality metrics.
