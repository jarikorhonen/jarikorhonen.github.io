##Research Profile

During my research career, I have been working on several different topics, mostly related to multimedia communications and Quality of Experience (QoE). I did my PhD about packet loss resilient audio streaming for Nokia Research Center, Tampere, Finland, and defended my dissertation in May 2006. More recently, I have been working mostly on visual and audiovisual quality assessment, covering both subjective methodologies and objective quality metrics.
