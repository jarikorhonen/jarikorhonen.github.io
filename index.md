## Research Profile

During my research career, I have been working on several different topics, mostly related to multimedia communications and Quality of Experience (QoE). I did my PhD about packet loss resilient audio streaming for Nokia Research Center, Tampere, Finland, during 2001-06. Since 2008, I have been working mostly on visual and audiovisual quality assessment, covering both subjective methodologies and objective quality metrics. You will find some of my recent research highlights with the related resources below.

The list of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=IrbP5FUAAAAJ).


### No-reference video quality assessment

As networks are becoming faster and mobile camera technology more advanced, digital video is all around us. In practice, quality of the video content distributed in the Internet is often impaired by different kinds of distortions, attributed to compression, transmission errors and capture artifacts, such as jerkiness and sensor noise. Subjective quality assessment is often impractical due to the required time and resources. This is why there is need for algorithm-based video quality assessment, known also as *objective video quality metrics*. Objective video quality metrics have several potential applications, such as automatic quality labeling in video distribution services, continuous quality monitoring in streaming systems and user feedback in mobile capture devices, such as tablets and smartphones. Some resources from recent relevant work in NR-VQA is available below.

### Subjective image and video quality assessment

Subjective image and video quality assessment is still important, because it is the only way to obtain the ground truth for human opinions on visual quality. Recently, we have tried some new methodologies, such as involving a touchscreen to detect packet loss artifacts in video sequences, and using rank ordering method to decide the preference between different post-processing methods for photo enhancement. Some resources from recent relevant work in NR-VQA will be available below soon. 

### Miscellaneous

In addition to quality assessment, I have baan working also on other topics, ranging from collaborative filtering to image enhancement. Some recent studies are showcased here.
